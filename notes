Go will handle all high level stuff, Computer Vision, mapping exc



Arduino will get motor command from Go, and return physical sensor data.
The arduino will also react to physical sensors, i.e stop going forward if we hit something

Communication will be with json


to uC ->  {"motor1":50,"motor2":50,"redLED":0,"greenLED":3}
from uC->   {"bump1":False,"bump2":False,"bump3":False,"bump4":False,"sonar1":15,"sonar2":20,

RPI will talk direct to GPS,
uC may also have 9 axis sensor





we have a decision channel
